## Taxonomy Chart
- Initially suggested by Carolus Linnaeus, a taxonomy chart is used in biology to classify all living things.
- In particular, the chart is the branch of biological systematics that is concerned with the naming of organisms (according to a pre-defined set of rules), identification (referring specimens to previously named taxa), and classification (ordering taxa into a hierarchy based on perceived characteristics) based on shared characteristics.
  - For example, succulents in a plant taxonomy chart collect many plants that are very similar in appearance, including size and sharpness.
- Organisms are grouped into taxa and these taxa can be aggregated to form a more inclusive group of higher rank, thus creating a taxonomic hierarchy.
- Taxonomy classification, namely taxonomic rank, is a group of organisms related to commonalities of each other in a taxanomic ordered structure. Major taxonomic categories include eight topics:
  1. Domain
  2. Kingdom
  3. Phylum
  4. Class
  5. Order
  6. Family
  7. Genus
  8. Species
- The taxonomic categories are colloquially known as "the phylogenetic tree" and ultimately organize all life on earth according to their inter-relationships stemming from a common ancestor.
  - The tree is constantly evolving as more species are discovered and require naming/identification/classification.

## Binomial Nomenclature
- Two-part name for every species including the genus and species name of a given species.
