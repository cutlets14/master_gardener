# Chapter 9 - Integration Pest Management/Plant Diagnostics

## Notes from chapter reading

## Notes from video lecture
### Goal
Maintain a quality landscape by preventing pest problems and minimizing the use of pesticides.

### Developing an IPM plan
1. Cultural practices
- Focus on key plants - select plants based on subjective means - location or sentimental value or a plant experiencing a problem
- Record ideal practices/conditions for growth and maintenance of each key plant
2. Record-keeping and monitoring plants
- Identify and record common pest problems for each key plant - research and capture at least 5; combo of insects and diseases
- Monitor once during the winter or dormant season, every 2 weeks in the growing season (more frequently for home gardens)
- Record-keeping
  - Sample categories
    - Name of plant
    - Location
    - History - transplant, disturbances, fertilization practices, pesticide treatments
    - Signs - insect damage, insects
    - Symptoms - chlorosis, wilting, scorch, left spots, lead frop, girdling roots
  - Keeping track of beneficials is also important
  - Sample forms - https://schoolipm.tamu.edu/forms/ipm-inspection-monitoring-and-sighting-logs/
  - Actions to take:
    - Soil test
    - Fertilization
    - Pruning
    - Watering
    - Mulching
    - Weeding
- Sample turf site map
  - Applicable for both indoor and outdoor plants
  - Indoor - EWNS; proximity to windows or vents or sources of heat
3. Using physical barriers
4. Using beneficial insects
5. Pesticide use

### IPM Monitoring Supplies
1. 5 gallon bucket or backpack
2. Container for samples
3. Clipboard, pen, and paper
4. Ruler
5. Pocket guides
6. Pocket lens/magnifying glass
7. Flashlight
8. Pen/budding knife

### IPM Cultural Practices
- Soil testing - good to incorporate with site map
- Proper fertilization and lining
- Mulching - keeps weed pressure down, conserves soil moisture
- Pruning
- Watering
