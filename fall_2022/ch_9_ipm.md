# Chapter 9 - Integration Pest Management/Plant Diagnostics

## Notes from chapter reading

## Notes from video lecture
### Goal
Maintain a quality landscape by preventing pest problems and minimizing the use of pesticides.

### Developing an IPM plan
1. Cultural practices
- Focus on key plants - select plants based on subjective means - location or sentimental value or a plant experiencing a problem
- Record ideal practices/conditions for growth and maintenance of each key plant
2. Record-keeping and monitoring plants
- Identify and record common pest problems for each key plant - research and capture at least 5; combo of insects and diseases
- Monitor once during the winter or dormant season, every 2 weeks in the growing season (more frequently for home gardens)
- Record-keeping
  - Sample categories
    - Name of plant
    - Location
    - History - transplant, disturbances, fertilization practices, pesticide treatments
    - Signs - insect damage, insects
    - Symptoms - chlorosis, wilting, scorch, left spots, lead frop, girdling roots
  - Keeping track of beneficials is also important
  - Sample forms - https://schoolipm.tamu.edu/forms/ipm-inspection-monitoring-and-sighting-logs/
  - Actions to take:
    - Soil test
    - Fertilization
    - Pruning
    - Watering
    - Mulching
    - Weeding
- Sample turf site map
  - Applicable for both indoor and outdoor plants
  - Indoor - EWNS; proximity to windows or vents or sources of heat
3. Using physical barriers
4. Using beneficial insects
   1. There are a few types based on what they do:
      1. Predators - Lady Bugs, Preying Mantis etc.
      2. Parasitoid - Braconid wasp (combat Tomato Hornworm)
      3. Entomopathogenic nematodes - use with specificity as usage can be detrimental
    2. Release at an appropriate time
    3. Recognize your beneficial insects
5. Pesticide use
   1. Spot treat
   2. Avoid using pesticides that have a residual

### IPM Monitoring Supplies
1. 5 gallon bucket or backpack
2. Container for samples
3. Clipboard, pen, and paper
4. Ruler
5. Pocket guides
6. Pocket lens/magnifying glass
7. Flashlight
8. Pen/budding knife

### IPM Cultural Practices
- Soil testing - good to incorporate with site map
- Proper fertilization and lining
- Mulching - keeps weed pressure down, conserves soil moisture
- Pruning
- Watering

## Winter Protection
- Select hardy plans and appropriate sizes
- Avoid fertilizing after July 15, until the dormant season
  - Why? Fertilization stimulates new growth and the plant material may die as a result of coinciding first frost
- Apply anti-desiccants to broad leaf evergreens
- Mulch after the ground freezes
  - Mulch keeps soil temp constant preventing cycles of soil expansion and contraction
- Protect small shrubs with wind breaks
